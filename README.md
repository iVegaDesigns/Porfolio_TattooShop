# Tattoo Shop
This is one of the first assignments we were given the freedom to design a project for a client. I was given simple parameters to follow. We were to use Bootstrap to build out this site. I got this idea due to the numerous tattoo shop around Tampa that didn't have a website. This took place during peak covid season. I learned during this project the use of rows and columns that Bootstrap asks for in a responsive design. I also had fun getting the carousel to work properly. I figured if I was going to freelance, this is how I get startedâ€”showcasing my work.
